# Blazor MoonPhase App

Blazor MoonPhase application is a .NET 5 Blazor WebAssembly based application which allows the user to determine the moon’s phase and its appearance by entering a date/time and the user’s current hemisphere

# Inspiration

This application is inspired by an article from [Khalid Abuhakmeh](https://blog.jetbrains.com/author/khalid-abuhakmeh/) who is a Developer Advocate at JetBrains. Here is the link to his article: [https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2020/09/25/build-a-xamarin-forms-moon-phase-app/](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2020/09/25/build-a-xamarin-forms-moon-phase-app/). Khalid created a MoonPhase app using Xamarin Forms. Blazor MoonPhase application reuses most of the logic Khalid did in his Xamarin Forms application. I have copy & pasted most of the logic and rebuilt the UI using Blazor. The objective of Blazor MoonPhase app was to showcase how code can be reused when you do fullstack .NET.
